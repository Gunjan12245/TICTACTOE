🎮 Tic Tac Toe – Python & Pygame
This project is a fully functional Tic Tac Toe game built using Python and the Pygame library. It showcases my ability to solve logical problems, implement game mechanics, and create interactive user experiences through graphical programming.
🧠 Problem Statement
Build a two-player Tic Tac Toe game with:
- A clean graphical interface
- Turn-based logic and win detection
- Visual feedback for moves and winning combinations
- Option to restart the game without restarting the program
🔍 My Problem-Solving Approach
- Game Board Logic: Used NumPy arrays to represent a 3x3 grid and track player moves.
- Win Detection: Implemented functions to check horizontal, vertical, and diagonal win conditions.
- Graphical Rendering: Used Pygame to draw grid lines, circles (Player 1), and crosses (Player 2) with dynamic positioning.
- Event Handling: Captured mouse clicks to register moves and keyboard input (R) to restart the game.
- State Management: Controlled game flow using flags (game_over) and player switching logic.
🛠️ Technologies Used
